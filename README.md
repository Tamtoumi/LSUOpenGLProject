# 3D Modeling Parallel Progressive Mesh Demo

## Authored by: Devon McDonald, Haytham Bachar, Shaun Jullens, and Brandon Baye

[For starter progressive mesh code we worked off of click here](https://github.com/HsiaTsing/ProgressiveMeshes)

-	To run the project just open the MeshSimplification.sln file and run with debugger.
-	The console will wait for you to input the number of threads to use when collapsing in parallel.
- If you are doing sequential collapse enter an arbitrary integer.
-	Press ‘o’ to switch to sequential collapse of mesh (default is parallel).
-	Press ‘b’ to collapse the mesh fully.
-	After mesh is fully collapsed press ‘p’ and a plot figure will be displayed of the Faces Collapsed vs. Time (ms).
