-	To run the project just open the MeshSimplification.sln file and run with debugger.
-	The console will wait for you to input the number of threads to use when collapsing in parallel.
⋅⋅⋅If you are doing sequential collapse enter an arbitrary integer.⋅⋅
-	Press ‘o’ to switch to sequential collapse of mesh (default is parallel).
-	Press ‘b’ to collapse the mesh fully.
-	After mesh is fully collapsed press ‘p’ and a plot figure will be displayed of the Faces Collapsed vs. Time (ms).
